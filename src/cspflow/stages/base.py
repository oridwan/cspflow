"""What a stage is.

Every stage is a pure, idempotent, resumable function over the database:
`(rows in state X) -> (rows in state Y)`.  Nothing is passed between stages on
disk or by filename convention, which is what makes restart free -- kill
anything, rerun the same command, and it resumes from the rows.

Stages come in two kinds and the difference is not cosmetic:

*   **In-process** (`source`, `reference`, `calibrate`, `filter`, `analyze`) run
    in the driver itself, in seconds to minutes.  They need no scheduler.
*   **Submitted** (`generate`, `screen`, `dft`) go to the queue.  That is the
    entire scheduler surface -- three stages -- which is what replaces the ~210
    shell wrappers in the legacy campaigns.

The protocol below is deliberately small.  A stage says what work is ready,
takes as much of it as the driver's budget allows, describes the job, and later
reconciles a finished job back into the database.  It never decides how much to
submit, never sleeps, and never talks to the scheduler; the driver owns all
three, so throttling and budget policy exist in exactly one place.

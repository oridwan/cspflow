"""Stage 4a -- `calibrate:mp`, the free calibration.

Runs on MP phases the moment they are fetched, **before** the MLIP relaxes
anything, and needs nothing from the candidates. So it can run at the very start,
in parallel with generation: if MatterSim is bad at Sm you learn it in minutes
rather than after a GPU-day of MatterGen.

One forward pass per reference structure. For the whole 36-system magnet
campaign that is ~359 structures, seconds of GPU.

**What it does not do, and why.** It does not fit an energy correction. A
per-element correction is the only physically motivated form, and it moves
`e_above_hull` by ~10⁻¹⁵ eV/atom — exact cancellation along the tie-line,
measured on a real 41-phase Sm–Fe–Ti hull (D067). Fitting one would produce a
number that looks like a result and changes nothing.

**What it cannot replace.** Universal MLIPs of this class are trained on
MP-derived trajectories, so MP phases are close to in-distribution and 4a is
substantially a self-consistency check. It catches gross failure, not subtle
bias. The structures the campaign actually cares about are *generated*, often in
prototypes absent from MP — that is the out-of-distribution set, and only
`calibrate:pilot` (4b) tests the model there. Which is why 4a defaults to
`warn` and 4b to `block`.

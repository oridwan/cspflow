"""Stage 1 -- structure generation.

A submitted stage, and the only one whose unit of work is a *composition* rather
than a structure.  Everything upstream of it is bookkeeping; everything
downstream is arithmetic on structures that exist.  This is where the campaign
starts spending GPU time.

Three choices here are worth stating, because each is a departure from the
legacy script and each was made against a measurement of it.

**Compositions are grouped by their requested count, not processed one at a
time.**  MatterGen loads a checkpoint and initialises CUDA on every invocation.
The legacy wrapper called it once per composition per supercell -- for the
ternary campaign, more than 1,692 loads.  MatterGen's own CLI accepts a *list*
of target compositions, so a group that wants the same number of structures each
costs one load between them.  The catch is that MatterGen divides the total by
the number of compositions with `//`, silently dropping the remainder and
returning nothing at all when the product is smaller than the list; the plan in
`generators/base.py` is constructed so the division is always exact.

**A task owns its own output directory tree, and results come back by
composition, not by position.**  See `generators/mattergen_engine.py`.

**Yield is recorded.**  `n_target` and `n_produced` both live on the composition
row, so `csp status` can say "1,692 compositions asked for 177,120 structures and
got 166,004" instead of reporting a number that only ever means "what arrived".

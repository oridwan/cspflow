"""MatterSim.

Deliberately does **not** use `mattersim.applications.batch_relax.BatchRelaxer`,
which is what `prescreen.py` uses. Measured on this machine, in both the new
`cspflow` environment and the user's pre-existing `mattersim` one, it is broken
against the installed ASE in two independent places:

    from mattersim.applications.batch_relax import BatchRelaxer
    ImportError: cannot import name 'Filter' from 'ase.constraints'
        # ASE moved Filter (and the cell filters) to ase.filters

    # after shimming that:
    File ".../mattersim/applications/batch_relax.py", line 122, in step_batch
        if opt.converged():
    TypeError: Optimizer.converged() missing 1 required positional argument

The first is a one-line compatibility shim. The second is inside mattersim's own
loop and cannot be fixed from outside without patching its internals, which is
further than a compatibility layer should reach. `BatchRelaxer` in this version
also accepts no step limit at all -- `max_n_steps` is not a parameter, though
`prescreen.py` passes one -- so an unconvergeable structure has nothing to stop
it.

So relaxation runs through ASE's own optimizer against `MatterSimCalculator`,
which is fully supported by the installed ASE, honours `max_steps`, and lets us
own the convergence test. The cost is losing MatterSim's GPU batching; the
benefit is a relaxation that stops when told to and reports honestly whether it
converged. Measured on CPU (login node): 0.8 s for a 2-atom cell, 10.8 s for 54
atoms, ~60-230 ms per optimizer step.

Physical sanity, same run:

    Fe bcc  a = 2.8369 A  (expt 2.87)   E/atom = -8.47789 eV
    Co fcc  a = 3.5160 A  (expt 3.545)  E/atom = -7.06160 eV
    Ni fcc  a = 3.5064 A  (expt 3.524)  E/atom = -5.77280 eV

and a 16-atom and a 54-atom Fe supercell relax to the same E/atom to 5 decimal
places, which is the internal consistency check worth having.

"""What an MLIP engine is, and the gates every structure passes before one runs.

The interface is small on purpose: a single point, a relaxation, and a batch of
relaxations. Everything interesting is in what `RelaxResult` refuses to
conflate.

**Convergence is computed here, not asked of the optimizer.** ASE 3.27 changed
`Optimizer.converged()` to require a `gradient` argument, so the obvious call
raises `TypeError` -- but the better reason to own the definition is that this
whole project turns on the difference between "the process finished" and "the
answer is usable". A relaxation that stops at the step limit is exactly the MLIP
counterpart of a VASP run that hits `NSW`, which was 61% of `redo-new-ter-mag`
(D027), and it is recorded the same way: it ran, it is not converged, and its
geometry is not a minimum.

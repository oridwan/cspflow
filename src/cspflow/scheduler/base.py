"""What a scheduler is, independent of SLURM.

Only three stages are ever submitted -- `generate`, `screen` and `dft` -- which
is the whole scheduler surface (pipeline.md sec.4.4).  Everything else runs
in-process in seconds.  Keeping that surface this small is what replaces the
~210 shell wrappers in the legacy campaigns.

Two ideas here do real work:

`JobState` separates **what the scheduler did** from **what the science did**.
A VASP job that exits cleanly having failed to relax is `COMPLETED` to SLURM,
and 61% of the jobs in `redo-new-ter-mag` were exactly that.  The scheduler
layer only ever reports the first kind; `relaxation.converged` carries the
second, and nothing in this module is allowed to conflate them.

`Throttle` computes what can actually be in flight, which is never what the
config asks for on its own.  It is the smaller of the user's number, the QOS
submission cap, and how many jobs the CPU allocation cap physically permits.

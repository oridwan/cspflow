"""Run jobs as local subprocesses.

Two uses, and the second is the reason it is worth the file.  It makes
`machine: local` a real target, so the pipeline can be exercised on a laptop
with a tiny composition list.  And it lets the driver loop be tested end to end
without a scheduler, which matters because the driver's interesting behaviour --
resuming, throttling, retrying -- is exactly the behaviour that is painful to
test through SLURM.

The semantics deliberately match SLURM's where it costs nothing: a job gets an
id, its state is polled rather than returned, and a failed process becomes
`JobState.failed` with its exit code rather than an exception.  What is *not*
matched is queueing -- jobs run immediately and one at a time -- so the throttle
is honoured by the driver, not by this class.

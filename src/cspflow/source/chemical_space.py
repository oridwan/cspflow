"""Mode 1: element groups plus per-group ratio constraints.

Generalises `search_ternary_magnets.py` from a hardcoded ternary loop to N
groups, so binary, ternary and quaternary spaces use one code path.  Three
things change in the process, each of which was a latent bug in the original:

*   **The group is the unit of constraint, not a named role.**  The original
    takes `tm_rich_ratio=0.75` -- one named constraint that silently assumes a
    particular group is "the TM group".  Here `min_fraction`/`max_fraction` sit
    on whichever group they belong to, an absent key means unconstrained, and
    the binary case (where there is no third group to name) needs no special
    handling.

*   **Arity is explicit.**  The original expresses "two transition metals" as
    two separate groups T and T' drawn from the same list, plus a `T < TP`
    guard to suppress the duplicates that construction creates.  `pick: 2` on
    one group says the same thing with no duplicates to suppress, because
    `combinations` is unordered by construction.

*   **`t_over_t_prime_ratio` is deliberately not carried over.**  It is only
    applied `if not same_lists` -- and in every recorded run of the original,
    T and T' were the same list, so it never fired.  Worse, it is not
    well-defined once the two elements come from one unordered group: with
    `combinations` there is no "primary" and "secondary" to take the ratio of,
    so `n_T/n_T' >= 0.8` and `n_T'/n_T >= 0.8` are different constraints
    selected by nothing but iteration order.  If an intra-group balance
    constraint is wanted later it needs to be stated symmetrically (e.g. "no
    element below x of its group"), which is a new feature, not a port.

Enumeration is exhaustive but pruned: the recursion carries a running sum and
stops as soon as the remaining elements cannot fit under `max_atoms_formula`.

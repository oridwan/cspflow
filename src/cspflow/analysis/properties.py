"""Everything one finished relaxation is worth recording.

The rule this module exists to enforce is that a derived number is never
returned under a computed number's name.  Three pairs are easy to confuse and
all three are kept apart:

*   `m_dft_raw` (cell magnetisation) against `m_s_reconstructed` (a Hund's-rule
    model layered on the transition-metal sublattice).
*   the cell magnetisation against the sum over PAW spheres, which differ by a
    few percent because the spheres do not tile the cell.
*   the *relaxed* geometry against the input one -- a job that stopped at the
    ionic step limit has a CONTCAR, and it is not a relaxed structure.

Spacegroup is symmetry-analysed from the CONTCAR at a stated tolerance, never
inherited from whatever produced the input.  A generated structure is P1 by
construction and its relaxed form usually is not; carrying the input's symmetry
forward would report every candidate as triclinic.
